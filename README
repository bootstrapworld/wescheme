The user-level documentation for the project is maintained in:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Build dependencies:

Java 1.7 SDK should be installed, as should Apache Ant.  Racket 5.3.1 is
also a dependency.  All these should be accessible from $PATH.
Finally, our current build tools assume a Unix-like environment to run
shell commands, including 'unzip' and 'git'.

Note: Additionally, do not use python 3; use python 2. The file
calcdeps.py is incompatible with python 3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing WeScheme for local development


1.  First, check out the WeScheme repository from Github.

   $ git clone git://github.com/bootstrapworld/wescheme2012

Don't forget: we're using git submodules, so also make sure to:

   $ git submodule init
   $ git submodule update

to grab the external dependendies as well.  As of this writing, the
external dependency is CodeMirror.


2. You might also need to change wescheme.properties if you are
doing any development on the android packager or compilation server.
You probably don't need to touch this unless you really know what
you're doing.


3.  Run 'build-console-and-editor.rkt'.

THIS STEP IS IMPORTANT!

The script "build-console-and-editor.rkt" must be executed after any
changes are made to the javascript source files in war-src/js.  The
webapp itself uses files in war, which are built by
build-console-and-editor.  Also, the builder also re-compresses
JavaScript files (such as CodeMirror 2) with the Closure Compiler, so
you must run this every time you change the JavaScript files.



----------------------------------------------------------------------

Running WeScheme locally:

After running build-console-and-editor.rkt, use Apache Ant with the
'runserver' target.

   $ ant runserver

This will bring up a locally-running Webserver running off port 8080.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hacking WeScheme:

The directory structure of WeScheme is a fairly typical Java web app.

Treat war as an output distribution directory.  Do not try to modify
files in there directly.  Rather, the majority of the JavaScript files
can be found in:

   war-src/js

which are packaged up via Closure into single JavaScript files, one
per application page.

    console: war/console.jsp, war/js/console-calc.js

        Implements the directory listing of a user's programs.


    openEditor: war/openEditor/index.jsp, war/js/openEditor-calc.js

        Implements main editor window; implements the main WeScheme interface
        (REPL, text editor)


    view: war/view.jsp, war/js/view-calc.js
    run: war/run.jsp

        Implements the viewing and running of programs outside of the
        editing environment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Selenium Test Suite.

We use Selenium (http://seleniumhq.org)

To use the suite:

1. Install firefox
2. Install selenium IDE @ http://seleniumhq.org/download/
3. Open up firefox
4. To open selenium, in firefox go to Tools -> Selenium IDE
5. Visit the openEditor page of the wescheme instance in Firefox.
6. in the IDE, go to File -> Open Test Suite
7. Open "full-suite" in testing/
8. Run with the green arrows in the Selenium IDE


Note that the tests as currently written are have not yet been coded
to respect some of the delays introduced by asynchronous JavaScript, so
many of the tests will fail unless the speed of the testing framework is
set to slightly slower than the "Fast" speed.

Things still to change, from summer 2012:
(list (define x 5)) -> define: this variable is not defined should read "define: found a definition that is not at the top level"
(x) -> x: this variable is not defined should read "this function is not defined"

To turn off color highlighting, change the colors in war-src/js/openEditor/interaction.js to white (i.e. new Color(255, 255, 255)).
